# Java-Swing-Asteroid-Test
My personal take on remaking the arcade game "Asteroids" from scratch in Java Swing

#RUNNING THE GAME
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed on your computer
2. Download the game folder and extract it to a location of your choosing
3. Open the game folder in some IDE that can run .java files (VSCode recommended) and run the Project2Runner.java file

#**TO ADD**
Sound effects
Abstract asteroid shapes
Boss every 5 waves
Improve menu and overall style
